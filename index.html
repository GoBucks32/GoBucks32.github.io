                    <h2>So where are we going on our Road trip?</h2>
                    <p>Planning a trip can be very cumbersome at times. How much is this going to cost? Are we going to fly or drive? Which route do we take to get there?
                    </p>
                    <p>All of these questions can make you pull your hair (if you have any left). We can try to help you simplify all of these decisions and get going on your Road Trip of a Lifetime.

                    <p>Now that we have planned the Road Trip of a Lifetime we need to pack for this trip.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since we know where we are packing should be a little easier. Packing based on the climate you plan to visit, but will need to know what season they are in.
